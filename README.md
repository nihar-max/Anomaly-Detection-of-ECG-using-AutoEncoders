# Anomaly-Detection-of-ECG-using-AutoEncoders
An electrocardiogram — also called ECG or EKG — is often done in a health care provider's office, a clinic or a hospital room. ECG machines are standard equipment in operating rooms and ambulances. Some personal devices, such as smartwatches, offer ECG monitoring. Ask your health care provider if this is an option for you
